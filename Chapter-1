The room is completely dark and silent.

The woman tell:
- Did you think we were heard?
The man answer:
- Not sure if anyone could hear us.
After a short pause woman continue:
- It seemed that someone walked behind the door.
- Nevermind. I have something for you. When I went there about one or two blocks just befor the house I smel apple. I was surprised because I appeared in an apple garden, this garden was directly between building. It looks like a park without any fence around. My path took me near the apple trees. It wasn’t difficult to take an apple form the tree. 

A man turn on the light. It was a bedside lamp on the nightstand next to the bed. The lights were yellow because of the lampshade. But there wasn't enough light in the room to tell if the woman was blonde or brunette. The man was bald, and the contours of his even skull were clearly visible in the light of the lamp. He takes an apple from his bag and give it to the women.

- I have to go.

He kiss the women quickly and go out. Music became discernible in the silence that followed, it seems to be The Cure “Friday I'm In Love”.

After a minute or a bit more the woman put the apple in the trash and turn off the light.

- The apple is on a tree in the city. Does he think that it’s healthy food?
